This project contains a Dockerfile to set up a docker image for a developer.

== Build and usage
In order to build the initial docker image use the following command:

[source,bash]
----
docker build -t docker.io/reinhapa/openjdk-dev .
----

After the build finishes you can use the image right away using the following
command:

[source,bash]
----
docker run -it --name openjdk-dev -v <local_folder>:/openjdk docker.io/reinhapa/openjdk-dev
----

If you experience access problems due to SELinux you must flag your data
directory using the following command:

[source,bash]
----
chcon -Rt svirt_sandbox_file_t <local_folder>
----

After exiting the container, you can restart it as follows:

[source,bash]
----
docker start -i openjdk-dev
----
